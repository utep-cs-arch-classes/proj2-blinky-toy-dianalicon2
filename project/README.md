# Lab 2: Blinky-Buzzy-Toy

## Getting Started
to run the program, type in the command "make clean" followed by "make load"
while inside of the project directory. Now you are ready to use the toy!

## Cleaning Up

When using the tokenizer, you can clean up the files, or remove unnecessary
files, at any time by running "make clean"

## What Buttons?
The buttons used in this toy are S1, S2, S3, and S4 on the green board (where
the screen is).

## Button S1
S1 will cause the green led and red led to alternate 2 times per second.

## Button S2
S2 will cause the green light to alternate between dim and bright 2 times per
second (button S2 if faulty hardware, but the code is there).

## Button S3
S3 will cause the red light to alternate between dim and bright 2 times per
second.

## Button S4
S4 will play the a song...which should sound like the Super Mario theme... but
doesn't :(.

## Have fun!
